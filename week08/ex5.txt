*physical address:
The program knows the real layout of RAM and accessing a variable indicates,
the real address value of the variable stored in the physical RAM chips.

*virtual address:
All application memory accesses go to a page table abstracted by OS. 
The aforementioned page maps variables and data from the virtual to 
the physical address.
