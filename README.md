# Operation Systems Fall 2020 Innopolis University  
In this course which was in third semester of my education in IU. I learnt alot about UNIX standard libraries and operation systems thanks to awsome lectures of  Dr. Giancarlo Succi. Good to acknowledge the contribution of my friend and teacher assistant Xavier to fill the comprehention gaps with his comments during labs.
It was a sweet experience. hope this would be helpful to some of you on github community.
